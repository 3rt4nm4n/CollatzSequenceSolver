# CollatzSequenceSolver
Collatz Sequence is a sequence in which after initial value (n) the next value is n/2 if n is even or 3n+1 if n is odd. The sequence continues until the value is 1. In this program the user can either input a value, see the sequence and its length or user can see the longest Collatz Sequence with an initial value that is under 1 million. The question is from Project Euler (Problem #14) 

Make a sequence:
